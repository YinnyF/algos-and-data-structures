# Data Structures
* we will use data structures that come built in to almost all programming languages 
* explain the basics of how these structures work
* won't be going over how to use them in practise

### Overview
* explore a familiar data structure, Array - how it works, runtimes
* data type: Linked List
* accessing, updating, inserting, deleteing
* sorting algorithm
* under the hood, strings are characters stored in a particular order in an array

### What is a Data Structure

> A data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure

* example: are a data structure, that store a collection of values, and each value is referenced using a reference or a key (0, 1, 2, ...)
* homogeneous containers in Swift/Java, can only contain values of the same type
* heterogeneous structures in Python/Ruby, can store any kind of value

### Arrays
* in Python an `Array` is best represented by the `List` data type
* an Array is a contiguous data structure (stored in memory next to each other) - retrieving values is easy
* a non contiguous data structure (the structure stores the value as well as a pointer to where the next value is) - increases the runtime of common operations
* in Python, lists allocate contiguous memory for the _pointer_ to the value stored somewhere else in memory

### Operations on Data Structures
* access and read values
* search for an arbitrary value
* insert values at any point into the structure
* delete values in the structure

### Why do we need more data structures than a programming language provides?
