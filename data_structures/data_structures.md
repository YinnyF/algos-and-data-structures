# Data Structures
* we will use data structures that come built in to almost all programming languages 
* explain the basics of how these structures work
* won't be going over how to use them in practise

<!-- ### Overview
* explore a familiar data structure, Array
* understanding how Array works
* runtimes of Array
* data type: Linked List
* why?
* accessing, searching, deleteing
* sorting algorithm -->

<!-- ### Why do we need more data structures than a programming language provides? -->
