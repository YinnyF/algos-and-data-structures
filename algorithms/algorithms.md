# Algorithms

### What is an algorithm?
* A set of steps a program takes to finish a task

### Why learn algorithms?
* Know that an algorithm exists
* Understanding when to apply an algorithm (algorithmic thinking)
* Deeper understanding about complexity and efficiency in programming

### Defining an algorithm
* Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
* The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
* The steps need to be distinct
* Should produce a result
* Should complete in a finite amount of time

### How can we tell if an algorithm is correct?
* Consistent results

### Correctness
* An algorithm is said to be _correct_ if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output

### Efficiency
* Time complexity - how long it takes for an algorithm to run
* Space complexity - amount of memory taken up on the computer
* Use worst case scenario as a benchmark to measure

### Algorithmic thinking
* Clarify input bounds
* Worst-case scenarios
* Understanding what works better in a given context
